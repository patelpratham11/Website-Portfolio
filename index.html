                My name is <b>Pratham Patel</b> and I am a Sophomore at the University of Pittburgh.
                Outside of classes, I <b>love to read, solve puzzles, work my mind, workout, and go on runs</b>.
                I am currently studying <b>Computer Science</b> with a minor in Chemistry.
                I love a good challenge, whether that's in the form of a math question or a puzzle or if it's in the form of a CS project,
                I'll get the job done. I have created this website as a way to showcase my skills, my interests, my goals, what I have accomplished, and most importantly,

        <p>
          Outside of school, I love to keep myself busy. I am a <b>passionate amateur photographer.</b> I run an instagram account where I share my photos with the world, <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/2p_snaps/" target="_blank">@2p_snaps</a></b>.
          I use lightroom to edit my photos, primarily focusing on landscape, flowers, urban areas, and the beautiful bridges of Pittsburgh. Although I've ammassed a small following on Instagram,
          my main inspiration comes from the fact that I do this for fun and I love to see how my pictures have grown in style. I've included some of the picture I've taken below :).
          I love to let my creativity run free, expressing it through my photographs, writing, and anything else that makes me feel free.

            I would love for you to contact me, I'm currently open to <b>Internships, part-time or temporary job offers,</b> or <b>any kind of learning experience.</b> I have linked my <a href="https://github.com/patelpratham11", target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pratham-patel-38a348185/", target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="mailto:prp48@pitt.edu">email</a>,
            and you're already at my personal website. I wish to eventually join a company as a <b>Software Developer</b>, but I know that there are many applications for my skills
            and I want to be able to explore my options before committing to a single subfield.
            Thank you for viewing my website all the way through. I hope I was able to showcase both myself and my skills through this page,
            feel free to contact me for whatever reason and I hope you have a great day.
